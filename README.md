# A gentle introduction to GitHub and GitHub actions by using GitHub Desktop

> üôè Forked from https://github.com/mathurinm/github-assignment, a project started by Mathurin Massias, Thomas Moreau, and Alexandre Gramfort.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

- Download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
- Set up your GitHub account.
  - Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/login) account.
    - üí° Recommendation: use a personal email to create your GitHub account and not the one from your company / school (as you might not have access to it for life). Or consider one account for personal stuff and another account for professional use.
      - üí° If you have only one account with your personal email, your company will add your GitHub handle to their GitHub organization. The day you leave that company, you will be excluded from that organization, but you will keep your other personal GitHub repositories on your account.
    - üí° Choose your GitHub handle wisely, try to keep it professional.
  - Do the following: [Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).
    - üí° In short, setting up SSH (Secure Shell Protocol) allows you to authenticate to your GitHub account when pushing your code (without entering your password each time: this makes you save time and it is more secure). It is a cryptographic network protocol.
    - In the SSH key pair, you have a private key and a public key (`.pub` extension) on your local machine (e.g. laptop).
      - üö® *Never* share your private key. Do not push any keys (public or private) on a (public or private) GitHub repository.
      - üí° You must add the public key to `GitHub.com` (online): go to `Settings`, `SSH and GPG Keys`, `SSH keys`, then the `Authentication keys` section.
    - üí° If you have several local machines (e.g. laptops), each one of them must have a SSH key pair with the public key on `GitHub.com`. Often, each laptop has its own SSH key pairs, and your GitHub account will thus have several authentification keys.
- Download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/) and sign in (with your GitHub account).
  - üí° VS Code also has nice features for dealing with GitHub, but @sylvaincom personally prefers GitHub Desktop because from the GitHub web navigator it has a better integration than VS Code. Example: from a GitHub repository, you can click on `Code` then `Open with GitHub Desktop`. Then, from GitHub Desktop, you can open the repository in VS Code very easily (just a right click) to edit the code.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Doing a basic pull request (PR) by using GitHub Desktop

####  Fork and clone this GitHub repository:
- From this GitHub repository (on the web navigator), fork the repository by clicking on the `Fork` button on the upper right corner, then `Create a new fork`.
  - üí° Forking a GitHub repository amounts to making a copy of it in your own GitHub repositories.
  - üí° You can not directly modify @sylvaincom's public repository because you do not have the collaborator rights to do so. Hence, you must fork it.
- Clone the repository (of your fork):
  - From the web navigator, click on `Code`, then `SSH`, and `Open with GitHub Desktop`. This will automatically open GitHub Desktop.
  - Once on GitHub Desktop, click on `Clone` (modify the path if needed). This will clone the GitHub repository which corresponds to your fork (on `GitHub.com` online, also called the `remote`) on your local machine.
  - When asked _How are you planning to use this fork?_, select _To contribute to the parent project_.
- Create a branch named `<student_branch>` (for example name it `john_d` if your name is "John Doe") and switch to this branch (it should be done for you by default, check `Current branch`).
  - Avoid making any changes directly on the `main` branch (even of your fork).
- Click on `Publish branch`.
  - üí° Your `<student_branch>` branch, which was created on your local machine, will be published on `GitHub.com` online.
  - üí° More globally, a `push` amounts to publishing the changes from your local machine to `GitHub.com` online. The reverse, retrieving the changes on `GitHub.com` online to your local machine, is called a `fetch` or a `pull`.

#### Do your modifications:
- Click on `Open in Visual Studio Code` to open the code, corresponding to this branch of your forked repository, on VS Code. üí° Visual Studio Code must be selected as your *external editor* on GitHub Desktop.
  - On VS Code, on the bottom left, check that you are in the correct branch named `<student_branch>` (it should be done for you by default).
  - Select the `students.txt` file.
  - Modify this file by adding a ` -> done` at the end of the row with your name.
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Do not forget to save the file after your modification!

#### Publish your modifications and send a pull request (PR):
- Go back to GitHub Desktop.
  - Select the changed file named `students.txt` (it should be done for you by default).
  - Add a commit message (by default it should be `Update students.txt`, which is fine; or your commit message could be `Add --> done`). üí° A commit message is for documentation purposes, for the human developers to better understand quickly what you are doing.
  - Click on `Commit to <student_branch>` to commit your changes on your branch.
  - Click on `Pull origin` <u><i>if</i></u> GitHub Desktop does the suggestion, otherwise there is no need.
    - üí° If GitHub says that there is a conflict (because you modified lines that were modified by another student at the same time on the same file), resolve these conflicts.
  - Click on `Push origin`.
  - Click on `Preview Pull Request`.
  - Click on `Create pull request`. This will automatically open a web navigator.
    - üí° You can see that you are in `sylvaincom/github_tutorial` and that you are trying to apply your changes from your `<student_branch>` branch of your fork to the `main` branch of @sylvaincom's original GitHub repository.
- On the automatically opened web navigator:
  - Click on `Create pull request`.
    - üí° Instead of `Create pull request`, you could click on `Create draft pull request` (or create a PR then convert it to draft). Once you have finished working on your draft PR, you can click on `Ready for review` to notify the human reviewers that they can start taking the time to actually review your the changes suggested by your PR (a draft PR is still visible, the human reviewers can start having a quick look if they want to).
    - üí° Do forget to customize your PR title and include a description if needed. More generally, if your PR solves a GitHub issue, let's say issue #1234, your PR title should be the name of the issue and the description should be _Fix #1234_ and additional comments if needed.
    - üí° You can see what changes you made in the `Files changed` tab.
    - üí° For more information, see [Creating a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).
  - Now, a maintainer of the GitHub repository (here, your teacher with the `sylvaincom` GitHub handle) will have to approve your pull request.
    - üí° For information, if your PR looks good, the way a collaborator of the repository (owner, maintainer, etc) would do it is by clicking on your PR on the web navigator then clicking on `Merge pull request` then `Confirm merge`. This collaborator undergoes a [PR review](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews) to approve (or not) your changes.
    - Do not hesitate to let your teacher know that you created a PR so that he can manually merge it.
  - Once your pull request has been merged, you will see `Pull request succesfully merged and closed`. Click on `Delete branch`. Indeed, you no longer need this branch that has already served its purpose.
    - üí° You should not be able to delete a branch if this branch is currently opened.
      - Close the repository from VS Code.
      - On GitHub Desktop, switch to the `main` branch.
    - üí° After your PR has been merged, you can also delete your fork, but here do *not* delete your fork yet as we will use it in the second part of this lab.
    - üí° You can also delete a branch from GitHub Desktop. Right click on your branch `<student_branch>`, then click on `Delete`, then confirm with `Delete`. Same for your fork. ‚ö†Ô∏è Beware when deleting a branch on the remote (`GitHub.com`): make sure that you are not deleting someone else's on-going work!
  - You can check that your modifications have been applied by looking at the original GitHub repository on the web navigator, on the `main` branch, and clicking on `students.txt`, thus at https://github.com/sylvaincom/github_tutorial/blob/main/students.txt.

### üí° Some notes

- On the web navigator, on the page corresponding to your GitHub PR, you might see: `This branch is out-of-date with the base branch. Merge the latest changes from main into this branch.`. This means that while you were doing some changes in your branch, some changes from other users have been merged to the main branch, so you must retrieve these changes from the main branch and apply them to your branch.
  - On GitHub Desktop, when you are on your branch, click on the top menu on `Branch` then `Update from main` (that is not the same as `Fetch origin`). Then, click on `Push origin`.
  - On the web navigator, on your GitHub PR, you will then see the following commit comment: `Merge branch 'main' into <student_branch>`.

## üöÄ Doing an advanced PR with GitHub Actions (by using GitHub Desktop)

- On GitHub Desktop:
  - Create a branch named `<student_assignment_branch>` (for example call it `john_d_assignment` if your name is John Doe). Switch to this branch.
  - Open in VS Code.
  - Publish this branch (but do *not* create a pull request yet).
- On VS Code:
  - Open `numpy_question.py` (a file that should be contained in the GitHub repository).
  - Read the instructions at the beginning of `numpy_question.py`.
  - Modify `numpy_question.py` according to the instructions.
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Do *not* modify `test_numpy_question.py`. üí° More generally, do *not* modify Python files that start with `test_`: as their name suggests, they perform the tests (checks) on your submitted code.
- Create a pull request.
  - üí° Instead of creating a (normal) PR, you can create a draft PR and convert it to ready for review only once you have finished your changes.
- See if all tests have passed (‚úÖ).
  - If not, if a check has failed (‚ùå), keep pushing to your branch (*the same one*) until the continuous integration (CI) system is green (‚úÖ).
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Do *not* open a new pull request every time you push. Keep pushing your changes (e.g. commit) on the same draft PR until you are done.
- When `All tests have passed` (‚úÖ), you have finished this lab!
  - üí° The teacher will *not* merge your PR, or all students would have your correct answer.

## üë®‚Äçüè´ Some key take-aways

- *Always* know where you are:
  - Which virtual environment?
  - Which directory?
  - Which GitHub repository? The original one or your fork?
  - Which branch?

## üìö About `git`

By using GitHub Desktop, you did not see all the `git` commands that you would have to be run from your shell.

Basically, imagine that there is a specific `git` command for all the clicks you do on GitHub Desktop. Hence, it is quite difficult to teach them in a short lecture. Moreover, as a first lecture on GitHub, you might be confused with the bash commands and loose sight of the global philosophy of how `git` / GitHub works.

Yet, it is strongly recommended to learn `git` from the command line on your own. Here are some resources:
- [Mathurin Massias' lecture notes](https://github.com/mathurinm/github-assignment?tab=readme-ov-file#general-information). Also see [Mathurin Massias' lab](https://github.com/mathurinm/github-assignment?tab=readme-ov-file#i-the-assignment) which is the equivalent of this lab you did using GitHub Desktop but with `git` commands. Notice how more complicated it looks...
